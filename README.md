# Quantum-Computing-and-Programming
This repository contains quantum computing algorithms such as Grover Search, Simon's Algorithm and Oracle. It also contains Quantum Kernel Machine Learning SVM classifier made using Qiskit and Python. 
Applied Quantum Kernel Machine Learning for the classification of ad hoc dataset support vector machine classification algorithm.
Implemented Grover Search Algorithm using Qiskit and simulated on qasm simulator and IMBQ.
Executed Simon's Algorithm and Oracle using Qiskit to show an exponential speed-up versus the best classical algorithm in solving a specific problem.
